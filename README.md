# Configurable Geoserver Vector Tile Viewer

Accepts one Geoserver Vector Tile polygon layer, along with 
configuration options and multiple Mapbox GL styles. 
This app loops through the styles, uses the name of the style within 
the style picker, and applies the style on the client side.
Also in the config.js file are the display fields that the
info popup uses to display feature information.
